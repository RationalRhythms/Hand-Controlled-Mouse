# Hand-Controlled Mouse

This project uses MediaPipe hand tracking and OpenCV to control the mouse cursor with hand gestures. It detects finger positions to move the cursor smoothly and perform left and right clicks based on specific finger combinations.

**Features:**

* Cursor movement controlled by index finger position.
* Left click triggered by index and middle fingers up.
* Right click triggered by index finger and thumb up.
* Smooth cursor movement with adjustable smoothing factor.
* Click cooldown to prevent accidental multiple clicks.
* Real-time hand landmarks visualization.
